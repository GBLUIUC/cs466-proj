## CS466 Final Project
CS 466 Final Project: Implementation and Benchmarking of Hirschberg Algorithm

# Dependencies
This code requires

Python 3
Python memory_profiler package

# Usage
You can simply run the comparison between Needleman-Wunsch and Hirschberg with command

'python3 hirschberg.py'

This will run both methods on the three biological datasets in ./data/cmp*.txt. The format of these input data files is simply a line for each sequence. After running the algorithms, it will report the scores, alignments, running times, and peak memory usages in the corresponding ./results/out*.txt file. Please see the project report for analysis and discussion of these results.
